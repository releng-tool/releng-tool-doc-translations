"releng-tool is developed in Python_ and requires either Python_ 2.7 or "
"3.4+ to run on a host system. A series of optional tools are required if "
"certain stages and/or features are used. For example, projects fetching "
"sources from Git_ will require the ``git`` tool installed; projects with "
"patches will required the ``patch`` tool.  While some features may be "
"operating system-specific (e.g. autotools features are designed for "
"Linux-based hosts), releng-tool can work on various operating system "
"variants."
