msgid "releng-tool is developed in Python_ and requires either Python_ 2.7 or 3.4+ to run on a host system. A series of optional tools are required if certain stages and/or features are used. For example, projects fetching sources from Git_ will require the ``git`` tool installed; projects with patches will required the ``patch`` tool.  While some features may be operating system-specific (e.g. autotools features are designed for Linux-based hosts), releng-tool can work on various operating system variants."
