The extraction phase will later use this folder to find package content to prepare against."

Sources can either be fetched and placed into an archive, in a similar fashion as fetching an archive from HTTP/FTP locations, or sources can be fetched into a \"cache directory\" if supported (typically distributed version controlled sources). For example, Git_ repositories (see also Git's |--git-dir|_) will be stored in the root directory's cache folder (e.g. ``<ROOT>/cache``). During the extraction stage, target revisions will be pulled from the cache location using the ``git`` client."
