"Packages can describe where external content should be fetched from. The "

"downloading an archive from an HTTP/FTP location. Assets acquired in this"
" manner are downloaded into the root directory's download folder (e.g. "
"``<ROOT>/dl``). The extraction phase will later use this folder to find "
"package content to prepare against."

"releng-tool also supports the fetching of content from version control "
"systems. Sources can either be fetched and placed into an archive, in a "
"similar fashion as fetching an archive from HTTP/FTP locations, or "
"sources can be fetched into a \"cache directory\" if supported (typically"
" distributed version controlled sources). For example, Git_ repositories "
"(see also Git's |--git-dir|_) will be stored in the root directory's "
"cache folder (e.g. ``<ROOT>/cache``). During the extraction stage, target"
" revisions will be pulled from the cache location using the ``git`` "

"In most cases, the extraction phase will process archives (e.g. "

"Git_ and Mercurial_ sources have their own extraction implementations to "

"releng-tool attempts to minimize the impact of a host system's "

"ignore these external environment variables. Some exceptions apply such "
