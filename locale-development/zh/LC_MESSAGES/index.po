"releng-tool can be used to assist in the release engineering of a "
"project. This tool allows a user to define one or more packages to "
"process. Each package has the ability to perform several stages: "
"fetching, extraction, patching, configuration, building and installation."
" What a package defines will vary for a given project. The simplest type "
"of package is script-based that allows a user to define custom scripts on"
" how to perform various stages of the release engineering process. A "
"package is not required to handle every stage. Helper package types are "
"provided, such as autotools, for projects using common build "
"capabilities."
msgstr "releng-tool 可用于协助项目的发布工程。此工具允许用户定义要处理的一个或多个组件。每个组件都能够执行几个阶段：拿到，提取，修补，配置，构建和安装。组件定义的内容会因应所给的项目而定。最简单的组件类型是以脚本为本的，它允许用户自定义脚本，从而决定如何执行发布工程过程的各个阶段。组件不一定在处理每个阶段时都用得上。为使用通用构建功能的项目，我们提供了帮助程序的组件类型，例如 autotools。"

"While this tool can assist in the configuration and building of a "
"project, the framework does not attempt to provide a perfect sandbox for "
"the process. Users defining their projects will have ownership on what "
"compilers/toolchains are used and the interaction between the "
"staging/target area and the host system."
msgstr "虽然此工具可以帮助配置和构建项目，但此框架并不试图为该过程提供完美的沙盒。为他们的项目下定义的用户将拥有使用的编译器/工具链以及分级/目标区域，与主机系统之间的交流的所有权。"
